  RandomDialogue:
  - Me and Pete will share a tea thanks. We don't want to spoil our appetite for
    dinner!
  - I'm really in the mood for something with Duckweed, maybe something milky? I
    have every faith in you!
  - You know what we are feeling adventurous. Make us a drink you think I'll like,
    I trust you luv!
  - Phew! Warm day, feeling really crispy out there. We could really do with some
    icy boba my dear!
  - I feel like a surprise tea today. Dont worry im not peeking!
  - This is just the type of place we like to see while out and about. Do you think
    you can avoid the citrus flavours?
  CorrectDrinkDialogue:
  - Chookers! Luv, this is just the trick!
  - I can't believe we are so lucky to have you here in the neighbourhood. This is
    great!
  - Hmm now this is great! You can really taste the pond!
  - How do you get the pearls to stay at the bottom? You must be so clever!
  - Don't you change a thing about this! Can this be my regular?
  - Next time we are here make sure whatever you did today, you do the same thing!
    Fabulous!
  IncorrectDrinkDialogue:
  - What do you think dear? Doesn't quite hit the spot does it!
  - This reminds me of when Sheldon's mum made grape trifle for our anniversary.
    That's not a compliment darling!
  - 'Well so long as you are trying love! I''ve never been a fan of flavours like
    orange. '
  - I'll be confit before I try that again!
  - 'Sheldon''s Mum would probably like this place. She''s never had very good taste. '
  - Oh bless your heart! You must be trying so hard, don't give up, you'll get there.
